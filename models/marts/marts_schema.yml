      Fact table containing all taxi trips from both yellow and green taxis.
      
      This is the core analytical table for trip-level analysis.
      Each row represents a single trip with:
      - Trip identifiers and service type
      - Pickup and dropoff locations and timestamps
      - Trip details (distance, passenger count, etc.)
      - Payment information and amounts
      
      Data is filtered for 2019-2020 only and excludes records
      with unknown pickup or dropoff locations.
